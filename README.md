## **Dungeon Mastr: The Rules of a Blockchain-Powered Adventure**

### **1. Types of Participants**
In *Dungeon Mastr*, players, game masters, and intelligent systems work together to create an exciting world driven by blockchain-based mechanics and classic role-playing systems.

#### **Player Roles**
- **Dungeon Mastr**: The storyteller and architect, who creates the adventures, controls the world, and adjudicates the rules.
- **Player**: Each player controls a single character, exploring the world, engaging in combat, and interacting with the environment.
- **NPC**: Non-player characters are controlled by the Dungeon Mastr, providing the world with flavor, challenges, and storylines.
- **AI Hybrids**: Automated systems that augment gameplay, controlling certain NPCs or environments based on predefined rules.

### **2. Characters**
Your adventure in *Dungeon Mastr* begins with the creation of your character, but there's a unique twist: your character is **generated deterministically** from your **Nostr ID**.

#### **Character Creation**
- **One Character at a Time**: Players can only have **one living character** at any moment. If your character dies, a new one can be **rerolled** and is again based on your Nostr identity.
- **Blockchain Genesis**: The creation of a new character begins with a **marked transaction** on the Bitcoin Testnet4 blockchain, anchoring your character’s existence in a provably fair and verifiable way.

### **3. Determinism and Game State**
The world of *Dungeon Mastr* is tightly tied to the Bitcoin **Testnet4 blockchain**, making the game's entire state traceable and verifiable by all participants.

#### **Deterministic World State**
- **Blockchain-Driven**: The game’s state is updated based on **blockchain transactions**, making all major events verifiable.
- **Immutable Events**: Every key action, including battles and interactions, is recorded as **transactions** or changes hashed and committed to Bitcoin Testnet4.
- **Transparency**: Anyone can track the game's progress and outcomes by inspecting the blockchain, ensuring trust and clarity.

### **4. Currency and Coins**
Money in *Dungeon Mastr* follows a fun but optional value system based on **testnet satoshis**.

#### **In-Game Currency**
- **1 Copper Coin** = 100 Testnet Satoshis
- **1 Silver Coin** = 100 Copper Coins
- **1 Gold Coin** = 100 Silver Coins
- **Platinum**: A rare and powerful currency, reserved for the highest echelons of wealth.

> **Note:** While the currency system gives flavor to the game, **coins are worthless in real life**. The game is about **fun** and **imagination**, not financial gain.

### **5. Rules of the Game**
The rules of *Dungeon Mastr* take inspiration from **Advanced Dungeons & Dragons (AD&D)**, but the game evolves and adapts based on the blockchain.

#### **Evolving Rules**
- **AD&D Core**: The rules begin by matching the classic AD&D system, covering character abilities, combat, experience points (XP), and more.
- **Adjustable Every 2016 Blocks**: Every **2016 blocks** (roughly two weeks), the community and Dungeon Mastr can propose **adjustments** to the rules, reflecting the ever-changing nature of the game.
- **Protocol-Based**: The rules are treated as a **protocol** that both humans and machines can reference and interact with.

### **6. Combat and Experience Points**
Combat is the lifeblood of many adventures, and in *Dungeon Mastr*, it follows the structure of AD&D but is influenced by blockchain transactions.

#### **Combat Mechanics**
- **AD&D Combat**: Combat follows AD&D mechanics, from attack rolls to damage calculations, creating a familiar system for experienced role-players.
- **Agreed Combat**: Players must **agree** to engage in combat. Once combat is initiated, the **transaction that formalizes the combat** becomes the source of **entropy** (randomness) for determining the outcome.
- **Blockchain-Backed Resolution**: The combat outcome, XP, and all relevant details are recorded in the **Testnet4 blockchain**, ensuring a fair and immutable result.

### **7. Nostr History and Legacy**
Every player's **Nostr identity** is part of the blockchain story. Your entire adventure, from character creation to epic battles, is immortalized.

- **Recorded History**: The **entire history** of each Nostr user is stored on the blockchain, creating a permanent, traceable record of all actions.
- **Legacy of Actions**: Your character’s deeds, victories, and defeats are recorded forever, ensuring that your in-game legacy lives on long after the adventure ends.

### **Inspiration for New Players**
*Dungeon Mastr* combines the best of classic tabletop role-playing games with the cutting-edge possibilities of blockchain technology. It's not just a game, but a **living, evolving world** where your actions matter, your decisions are recorded forever, and the rules themselves are shaped by the community.

This game provides the structure of AD&D with the innovation of a blockchain-driven world, where players can explore, fight, and build in a universe shaped by their imagination and cryptographic proof. Whether you're a fan of role-playing games or curious about blockchain, *Dungeon Mastr* offers a **unique, transparent, and exciting** adventure.

Join the game, create your character, and see how your Nostr identity unfolds into an epic journey.
